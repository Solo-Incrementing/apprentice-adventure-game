# The Apprentice Adventure Game

This is a visual novel style decision-driven role playing game where the player lives the life of an apprentice software developer.
The player's choices influence their stats and progress including the time which affect the availability of choices. The game state
is fully managed using a finite state machine implemented using the state design pattern.

## Roles and Responsibilities

As a solo project, all responsibilities were handled by me.

| Role                            | Responsibilities                                                                                                             |

## How to Run the Game

1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have a computer running the Windows 10 or 11 operating system.
2.  **Installation:** Clone this repository: `git clone [repository URL TBD]`, or download as a ZIP.
3.  **Setup:** Navigate to the project directory. If downloaded as a ZIP, unzip the folder using the Windows file explorer or use a third party tool such as 7zip. Open executables/vertical_slice.
4.  **Run:** Open/Execute the ApprenticeAdventure.exe file.

## Features

This initial vertical slice focuses on core gameplay with minimal art and user interface. You are able to make decisions that alter the state of the game and the potential options given to you at any point.

## Future

If the vertical slice is promising I want to turn it into a fully playable MVP. If the MVP is well received, I want to expand the decision making tree with more sections and complex behaviour such as decision based logic e.g If player does not brush in the morning, the effects of going to lunch with colleagues is reversed.
